# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to create a line of three of their symbols (either "X" or "O") horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
